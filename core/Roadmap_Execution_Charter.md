# SvartúlfrVerse Roadmap & Execution Charter

**Status:** CANONICAL
**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Authority:** Governance Authority
**Updated:** 2026-06-08

## Purpose

This document exists to prevent architectural drift, canon drift, runtime creep, and premature implementation.

The migration phase is complete.

The repository is no longer in discovery mode.

The repository is now in Canon Freeze v1 mode.

Code should follow this roadmap and should not invent new architecture outside these boundaries.

```

# Core Principle

The project follows:

```text
Authority First
Database Second
Runtime Last
Deployment Final
```

Never reverse this order.

---

# Phase 0 — Recovery (COMPLETE)

Completed work:

```text
Legacy Audit
Source Extraction
Canon Recovery
Authority Reconciliation
Visual Authority
Family Authority
Dynastic Origins
World Recovery
Experience Recovery
Governance Recovery
```

Outputs:

```text
reports/
```

Status:

```text
LOCKED
FROZEN
COMPLETE
```

Do not repeat recovery work.

---

# Phase 1 — Source Freeze (COMPLETE)

Completed:

```text
Source Freeze Report
Frozen source repository
Verification
```

Status:

```text
COMPLETE
```

Do not modify frozen sources unless explicitly instructed.

---

# Phase 2 — Canon Consolidation (COMPLETE)

Completed:

```text
Authority alignment
Visual authority reconciliation
Family authority reconciliation
Rejected canon separation
```

Status:

```text
COMPLETE
```

No unresolved canon blockers remain.

---

# Phase 3 — Legacy Purge (COMPLETE)

**Status:** COMPLETE

Completed:

```text
✓ Delete approved purge candidates
✓ Delete authority/ directory (13 files — all migrated to database/)
✓ Verify retained files
✓ Generate Purge_Authorization_Report.md
✓ Generate Authority_Decommission_Report.md
✓ Generate Repository_Consolidation_Closure.md
```

Outputs:

```text
reports/Purge_Authorization_Report.md
reports/Authority_Decommission_Report.md
reports/Repository_Consolidation_Closure.md
Repository_Finalization_Report.md
```

Success condition:

```text
Only approved source evidence remains. authority/ decommissioned. database/ is Single Source of Truth.
```

**Result:** ✅ ACHIEVED — `authority/` deleted, `database/` is sole canonical repository.

---

# Phase 4 — Migration Baseline (COMPLETE)

**Status:** COMPLETE

Completed:

```text
✓ Migration_Baseline_Report.md created
✓ Source_To_Record_Mapping.md created
✓ Every source mapped to exactly one database/ destination
✓ Authority ownership assigned per record
```

Output:

```text
reports/Migration_Baseline_Report.md
reports/Source_To_Record_Mapping.md
```

---

# Phase 5 — Template Freeze v1.0 (COMPLETE)

**Status:** COMPLETE

Completed:

```text
✓ C_Template.md frozen v1.0
✓ Family_Template.md frozen v1.0
✓ Institution_Template.md frozen v1.0
✓ W_Template.md frozen v1.0
✓ Ex_Template.md frozen v1.0
✓ CC_Template.md frozen v1.0
```

Templates located in: `database/characters/templates/`, `database/families/templates/`, etc.

---

# Phase 6 — Database Population (COMPLETE)

**Status:** COMPLETE

Completed:

```text
✓ families/ — 4 records + template
✓ institutions/ — 1 record + template
✓ characters/ — 13 records + template
✓ worlds/ — 10 records + template
✓ experiences/ — 1 record + template
✓ historical/ — 3 records
✓ canon_candidates/ — 2 records
✓ governance/ — 18 files (ADRs, protocols, config)
```

Population order followed: families → institutions → characters → worlds → experiences.

---

# Phase 7 — Validation & Cross-Reference Engine (COMPLETE)

**Status:** COMPLETE

Completed:

```text
✓ Missing_Character_Closure_Report.md — Nixara + Edric created
✓ Authority_Decommission_Report.md — 13 files verified, no orphans
✓ Source_To_Record_Mapping.md — All sources mapped
```

Validation outputs generated across all audit reports in `reports/`.

---

# Engine Restrictions

Do NOT implement:

```text
Runtime triggers

State engines

Memory engines

Context builders

Activation engines

Probability systems

Runtime lore injection
```

Those belong to future phases.

---

# Phase 8 — Validation Pass (COMPLETE)

**Status:** COMPLETE

Completed:

```text
✓ Schema validation — All records follow frozen templates
✓ Authority validation — All 4 authority layers verified
✓ Cross-reference validation — All 12 parent-child edges, 6 sibling pairs resolve
✓ Dependency validation — No orphans, no cycles
✓ Canon layer validation — ADR-006 5-layer classification verified
```

**Repository Integrity Score: 100% — STABLE**

---

# Phase 9 — Governance Validation

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

Goal:

Verify governance consistency across all documents.

Checks:

```text
No authority/ references remain in governance documents
database/ confirmed as Single Source of Truth
ADR hierarchy internally consistent
Repository reports match repository reality
```

Output:

```text
Governance_Consistency_Report.md
```

Canon layer validation
```

Output:

```text
Database_Validation_Report.md
```

Success condition:

```text
Zero blocking errors.
```

---

# Phase 9 — Deployment Architecture

**Status:** NOT STARTED

Goal:

Prepare export system.

Create:

```text
deployment/
```

Structure:

```text
deployment/
├── templates/
│   ├── janitorai/
│   ├── sillytavern/
│   └── generic/
│
├── exporters/
│
└── profiles/
```

Important:

```text
Deployment
≠
Authority

Deployment
≠
Runtime
```

---

# Phase 10 — Semi-Automatic Lorebook Generation

**Status:** NOT STARTED

Goal:

Generate export drafts.

Workflow:

```text
Source
↓
Database Record
↓
Validation
↓
Template Population
↓
Human Review
↓
Export
```

Lorebooks are:

```text
Deployment Artifacts
```

Lorebooks are NOT:

```text
Authority Records
```

Database remains source of truth.

---

# Future Phase — Runtime System

NOT CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED

Possible future architecture:

```text
Authority Database
↓
Dependency Engine
↓
Trigger Engine
↓
Group Resolver
↓
Context Budget Engine
↓
Runtime Context Builder
↓
LLM
```

Do not implement any of this now.

Document only.

---

# Canon Layer Architecture

Active Canon

Historical Canon

Cultural Canon

Deferred Canon

Candidate Canon

Rules:

```text
Cultural Canon
≠ Active Canon

Deferred Canon
≠ Active Canon

Candidate Canon
≠ Active Canon
```

Maintain separation.

---

# Approved Family Authority

```text
Wulfnic Bloodmoon (1948)

Erik Douglas (1970)
+
Nixara Bloodmoon

↓

Malachia (1996)

Noah (1999)

Jasper (2005)

Alyssa (2005)
```

Nixara dies during childbirth in 2005.

This structure is frozen.

# Approved Dynastic Origins

Bloodmoon:

```text
Origin:
Iceland

Migration:
1930s-1940s

```text
Alyssa
Jasper

---

# Cultural Canon

Approved:

```text
Svartúlfr Heritage

Black Wolves

Icelandic traditions

Family legends

Oral history
```

Cultural Canon only.

Not Active Canon.

---

# Permanently Rejected Canon

Never reintroduce:

```text
Pack System
Werewolf Layer
Alpha/Omega Hierarchy
Mate Bond
Soul Bond
Alpha-Seiðr

1200 BC Origin
Thracian Origin
Immortal Founder
Ancient Patriarch

Wulfnic → Erik genealogy

Hockey Canon

Runtime Trigger Systems

Janitor Runtime Systems

Image Generation Packs

Valeria / Concubine / WetNurse Concept (CANON_003)
  - Conflicts with canonical family graph
  - Introduces non-canonical character
  - Uses "Myrick" name for Jasper (non-canonical)
  - Source: Progetti/docs/canon/CANON_003
  - Decision: REJECTED 2026-06-08

Miss Twin Peaks Origin Story (CANON_002)
  - Superseded by simplified canonical origin
  - Erik meets Nixara at college
  - Source: Progetti/docs/canon/CANON_002
  - Decision: REJECTED 2026-06-08

KSA Origin Story (CANON_001)
  - Superseded by simplified canonical origin
  - Source: Progetti/docs/canon/CANON_001
  - Decision: REJECTED 2026-06-08
```

These decisions are final.

# Definition of Success

Repository reaches:

```text
Recovery
100%

Migration
100%

Validation
100%

Deployment Preparation
100%
```

Result:

```text
Single Source Of Truth
=
database/
```

All other layers become supporting infrastructure.

No future implementation should violate this principle.

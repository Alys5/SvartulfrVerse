# LOREBOOK SPECIFICATION

**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Date:** 2026-06-08  
**Authority:** ADR-005, ADR-006, R-009_Lorebook_Rules, R-007_Engine_Rules  
**Version:** 1.0 — Canon Freeze v1

---

## Purpose

This document defines the canonical structure, source attribution format, and canon-layer tagging system for lorebook generation. Lorebooks are **derived artifacts** — they organize and present canonical data for runtime consumption but hold no authoritative status.

**Authority:** All lorebook entries must be traceable to database/ records. Lorebooks must comply with R-009_Lorebook_Rules.

## Canon-Layer Tagging System

### Tag Definitions

| Tag | Label | Color | Usage |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|
| `[ACTIVE]` | Active Canon | 🟢 Green | Runtime-eligible facts. Full governance enforcement. |
| `[HISTORICAL]` | Historical Canon | 🔵 Blue | Documented historical facts. Reference only. |
| `[CULTURAL]` | Cultural Canon | 🟡 Yellow | Family traditions, oral history, myths. Flavor only. |
| `[DEFERRED]` | Deferred Canon | ⚪ Grey | Valid but not active. Not included in runtime lorebooks. |
| `[CANDIDATE]` | Candidate Canon | 🟠 Orange | Proposed material. Not included until approved. |

### Tagging Rules

```
RULE 1: Every lorebook entry MUST have exactly one canon layer tag.
RULE 2: Active Canon entries form the primary lorebook for runtime use.
RULE 3: Historical Canon entries are separated into their own section/file.
RULE 4: Cultural Canon entries are separated and clearly marked as non-factual.
RULE 5: Deferred and Candidate Canon entries are NOT included in runtime lorebooks.
RULE 6: Cultural Canon entries MUST include a disclaimer: "Cultural tradition — not runtime fact."
RULE 7: No entry may be promoted to a higher canon layer without Authority Decision.
```

- Cultural heritage preserved by Wulfnic Bloodmoon as memory keeper

**This entry must NOT be compiled as:**
- A runtime fact or character ability
- A supernatural element

**This entry MAY be used for:**
- Character dialogue (family stories)
- Background flavor (Icelandic heritage)
- Wulfnic's custodial role (memory keeper)

## Generation Rules

### R-009 Compliance

All lorebook generation must comply with R-009_Lorebook_Rules:

| Rule | Requirement | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| R-009-LRB-001 | Lorebooks are derived artifacts, not authority | Header disclaimer on every file |
| R-009-LRB-002 | Must not contradict canon | validation_engine cross-reference check |
| R-009-LRB-003 | All entries must reference database/ sources | Source attribution mandatory |
| R-009-LRB-004 | Must mark Active/Historical/Cultural | Canon layer tags on every entry |

### Generation Workflow

```
1. Select source domain (characters, families, worlds, etc.)
2. Query En_Core for all records in domain
3. For each record:
   a. Extract relevant fields per section mapping
   b. Classify canon layer (Active/Historical/Cultural)
   c. Generate entry with source attribution
   d. Apply canon layer tag
4. validation_engine: cross-reference all entries against database/
5. IF valid: Write lorebook file with metadata header
6. IF invalid: Reject entries, return error report
7. Update synchronization timestamp
```

### Forbidden Lorebook Operations

| Operation | Rule | Authority |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Create entries without database/ source | PROHIBITED | R-009-LRB-003 |
| Contradict database/ records | PROHIBITED | R-009-LRB-002 |
| Treat lorebook as authoritative | PROHIBITED | R-009-LRB-001 |
| Omit canon layer tags | PROHIBITED | R-009-LRB-004 |
| Treat Cultural Canon as Active | PROHIBITED | R-009-LRB-004, ADR-006 |
| Include Deferred/Candidate in runtime | PROHIBITED | ADR-006 |
| Add information not in database/ | PROHIBITED | R-009-LRB-002 |

---

## Synchronization Policy

- Lorebooks are regenerated when database/ records change
- Every regeneration includes a new synchronization timestamp
- Version-locked to canon version (currently 1.0)
- Outdated lorebooks must be flagged and regenerated

**Established by:** Architecture Review & Canon Authority  
**Approved by:** Canon Freeze v1 Governance

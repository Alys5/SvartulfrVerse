# PERSONALITY PROFILE Template (Main Character)

[ ! ] GEMINI DIRECTIVE: This is the master template for generating the `profile.md` (Personality box in JAI) for the NPC Cast (`C_*`). Keep it minimal, crucial, and always-on. DO NOT include conditional behaviors, detailed history, or dynamic triggers here - push those to the World Layer (`W_*`) or Experience Layer (`Ex_*`). This layer must only contain immutable facts (Identity, Psychology, Physiology), NEVER behavioral prompt instructions.

- Token Budget: Keep each character block extremely dense and strictly under ~600 tokens.
- Output ONLY the final code block. Do not output the instructional headers or brackets.
- MULTI-CHAR RULE: If this is an Ensemble Experience, include the Group Info variables at the top, and duplicate the character block for EACH NPC in the cast, replacing `{{char}} = {` with `CharName = {`. If it's a Solo Experience, omit the Group Info and just use `{{char}} = {`. Do NOT include the Player Avatar or POV Slot character here.

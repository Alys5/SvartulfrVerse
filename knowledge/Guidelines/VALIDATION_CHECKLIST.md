## How to Use This Checklist

This checklist is for manual validation audits. For automated validation, see `VALIDATION_PIPELINE_SPECIFICATION.md` (47-check automated pipeline).

**Severity Levels:**
- ✅ **PASS** — No issue detected
- ⚠️ **WARNING** — Non-critical issue or improvement opportunity
- ❌ **FAIL** — Critical violation; output must not proceed

**Workflow:** Execute checks in order. On first FAIL, STOP and report. Do not continue validation until FAIL is resolved.

## 5. AUDIT WORKFLOW

### 5.1 Pre-Validation Steps

Before running validation:

1. ☐ Identify the scope (single record, batch, full repository)
2. ☐ Identify the validation type needed:
   - **Cross-Reference** — For engine query responses
   - **Canon-Layer** — For bot/lorebook generation
   - **Authority Ownership** — For repository changes
   - **Traceability** — For all generated output
   - **Full** — For release candidates
3. ☐ Verify Canon Freeze v1 compliance (no rejected canon present)
4. ☐ Verify all source files exist in `database/`

### 5.2 Execution Order

```
Step 1: Cross-Reference Validation (Section 1)
    │
    ├── FAIL → STOP. Report broken references. Do not proceed.
    │
    ▼
Step 2: Canon-Layer Validation (Section 2)
    │
    ├── FAIL → STOP. Report layer violations. Do not proceed.
    │
    ▼
Step 3: Authority Ownership Validation (Section 3)
    │
    ├── FAIL → STOP. Report ownership violations. Do not proceed.
    │
    ▼
Step 4: Traceability Validation (Section 4)
    │
    ├── FAIL → STOP. Report traceability gaps. Do not proceed.
    │
    ▼
Step 5: Compile Results
    │
    ├── All PASS → Output is VALID
    ├── Any WARNING → Output is VALID WITH WARNINGS
    └── Any FAIL → Output is INVALID
```

### 5.3 Post-Validation Actions

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **VALID** | Release output. Log validation result. |
| **VALID WITH WARNINGS** | Release output. Log warnings. Recommend improvements. |
| **INVALID** | Reject output. Return error report. Log failure. Do not release. |

### 5.4 Error Report Format

For each FAIL, document:
1. **Check ID** (e.g., CR-105)
2. **Description** (what was found)
3. **Location** (file path and line)
4. **Resolution** (what must be fixed)
5. **Authority** (which ADR/Rule governs this check)

## 6. QUICK REFERENCE — COMMON FAILURES

| Failure | Check | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Character file defines parent-child | AO-005 | Move to `database/families/F_Parent_Child.md` |
| Wulfnic → Erik father-son found | CR-105 | Remove; legacy drift per ADR-001 |
| Cultural Canon presented as fact | CL-101 | Reclassify as flavor; add disclaimer |
| Valeria concept detected | CL-201 | Remove; rejected canon per ADR-006 |
| Bot card has no source attribution | TR-001 | Add provenance metadata |
| Experience redefines character name | AO-007 | Remove; identity is Character Authority |
| Lorebook contradicts database/ | CL-004 | Update lorebook; database/ is authoritative |

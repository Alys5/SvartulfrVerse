## 2. Douglas Family Education Map

| Character | Institution | Program | Source File | KSA |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Erik Douglas | UCLA | Football (former athlete) | C_Erik.md (L57, L81) | Should be Alumnus — **NOT IN CHARACTER FILE** |
| Logan Douglas | UCLA (implied) | Mechanical Engineering | C_Logan.md (L75) | Alumni (L74) |
| Malachia Douglas-Bloodmoon | UCLA | 5th-Year PhD, Sport Sciences | C_Malachia.md (L43, L67) | Alumni (L60, L69) |
| Noah Douglas-Bloodmoon | UCLA School of Law | 3L JD Candidate | C_Noah.md (L43, L57) | Alumni (L50, L58) |
| Jasper Douglas-Bloodmoon | UCLA | First-Year, Engineering | C_Jasper.md (L41-L45) | Legacy Eligible, Refuses (L53) |
| Alyssa Douglas-Bloodmoon | UCLA | Pre-Med, GPA 3.8 | C_Alyssa.md (L42-L46) | N/A (sororities not documented) |

**Key finding:** Erik Douglas is the only family member whose UCLA attendance and KSA membership are NOT documented in his character file. The family record (F_Douglas_Bloodmoon.md) notes he met Nixara at a KSA event, but C_Erik.md has no education or fraternity section at all.

## 3. Missing Link Report

### 3.1 Records That Should Reference I_UCLA But Do Not

| Record | Expected Reference | Priority |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| `database/characters/C_Erik.md` | Education section: "UCLA, Former Football Athlete, KSA Alumnus" | **HIGH** — Erik is the family patriarch; his UCLA/KSA connection is the origin story |
| `database/families/F_Douglas_Bloodmoon.md` | Reference to UCLA family tradition and KSA membership pattern | MEDIUM — provides family context |
| `database/families/F_Parent_Child.md` | Education attributes in relationship metadata | LOW — genealogical record, education is secondary |

### 3.2 Records That Should Reference L_LosAngeles But Do Not

| Record | Expected Reference | Priority |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| `database/families/F_Douglas_Bloodmoon.md` | Current headquarters: Los Angeles | MEDIUM —Douglas family relocated to LA |
| `database/families/F_Marriages.md` | Erik+Nixara married in Los Angeles | LOW — location detail |
| `database/characters/C_Nixara.md` | Los Angeles residence | LOW — implied by family location |
| `database/worlds/W_Contemporary.md` | Cross-reference to L_LosAngeles.md | MEDIUM — world record should link to location record |

### 3.3 Records That Should Reference O_KappaSigmaAlpha But Do Not

| Record | Expected Reference | Priority |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| `database/characters/C_Erik.md` | "KSA Alumnus — met Nixara Bloodmoon at KSA event" | **HIGH** — origin story |
| `database/characters/C_Alyssa.md` | "KSA legacy (mother's lineage)" — informational context | LOW — sisters of KSA not members |

### 3.4 Records That Should Reference I_UCLA_GreekLife But Do Not

| Record | Expected Reference | Priority |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| All KSA Alumni characters | Cross-reference to Greek Life system | MEDIUM — provides institutional context |
| `database/characters/C_Jasper.md` | "KSA operates within UCLA Greek Life" | MEDIUM — contextualizes his refusal |

### 3.5 W_Contemporary.md Missing Cross-References

The world record at `database/worlds/W_Contemporary.md` has a minimal UCLA entry:

```markdown
### UCLA
| Type | University campus |
| Context | Academic setting for younger generation |
```

This should be expanded to reference:
- I_UCLA.md (full institution record)
- L_LosAngeles.md (location record)
- I_UCLA_GreekLife.md (social system)

## 4. Promotion Candidates

The following entities appeared during scanning and may deserve promotion to formal records when canon relevance justifies it:

### 4.1 Locations (Potential L_ Records)

| Entity | Current Status | Evidence | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Westwood Village** | Described in L_LosAngeles.md only | Commercial/social hub for students — high narrative utility | MEDIUM — current district-level coverage may suffice |
| **Beverly Hills** | Referenced in W_Contemporary.md, character files | Douglas Estate location — high character relevance | MEDIUM — could be L_BeverlyHills or remain district |
| **Pasadena** | Referenced via L_RoseBowl only | Home of Rose Bowl — moderate relevance | LOW — L_RoseBowl covers this for now |
| **Hollywood** | Described in L_LosAngeles.md only | Entertainment industry proximity — moderate relevance | LOW — district-level coverage may suffice |

### 4.2 Institutions (Potential I_ Records)

| Entity | Current Status | Evidence | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **UCLA School of Law** | Mentioned in C_Noah.md only | Noah's institution — character-relevant | LOW — covered under I_UCLA for now |
| **UCLA Athletics** | Implied by C_Erik.md, C_Malachia.md | Football, boxing, MMA — character-relevant | LOW — no dedicated record needed yet |
| **DCC** | Documented in W_Contemporary.md with cross-reference | Erik's company — high narrative importance | **HIGH** — already has cross-reference, needs full I_DCC.md record |

### 4.3 Organizations (Potential O_ Records)

| Entity | Current Status | Evidence | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **UCLA Football Team** | Referenced in C_Erik.md, C_Malachia.md | Former athletes, game-day culture | LOW — develop if sports storylines expand |
| **Boxing/MMA Organizations** | Referenced in C_Malachia.md | Malachia's fighting career | LOW — develop if combat storylines expand |
| **UCLA Esports** | Mentioned in I_UCLA_StudentOrganizations.md | Gaming culture reference | LOW — develop if Jasper gaming storyline expands |

### 4.4 Faction Candidates (Future — Supernatural-Free for Now)

| Entity | Current Status | Evidence | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **DCC Corporate Network** | W_Contemporary.md + character files | Erik's power base — corporate intrigue | LOW — needs supernatural overlay approval first |
| **KSA Alumni Network** | O_KappaSigmaAlpha.md + character files | Multi-generational network — faction-ready | LOW — needs supernatural overlay approval first |

## 7. Critical Findings

### 7.1 Erik Douglas Gap
**Severity:** HIGH

`C_Erik.md` is missing an Education section entirely. It documents his DCC role, his marriage to Nixara, and his children, but says nothing about UCLA or KSA. This is a significant gap because:
- The family origin story (Erik met Nixara at KSA) is in F_Douglas_Bloodmoon.md but not in Erik's character file
- Erik is documented as "Former UCLA Football athlete" in two lines but has no formal education entry
- Without this, the KSA family tradition narrative is incomplete at the character level

### 7.2 DCC Institution Record Gap
**Severity:** MEDIUM

The Douglas Commerce Company (DCC) is one of the most important institutions in the SvartúlfrVerse — it is Erik's power base, the family's economic engine, and Noah's future workplace. It has no dedicated I_DCC.md record. W_Contemporary.md has an inline entry with basic data, and I_DCC_Security_BlackWolf.md covers the security division, but the parent corporation itself is undocumented as a formal institution record.

### 7.3 W_Contemporary.md Minimal UCLA Entry
**Severity:** LOW

The world record's UCLA entry is a one-liner. It should cross-reference I_UCLA.md and provide slightly more context given UCLA's centrality to the current narrative focus.

### 7.4 No KSA Alumni Cross-Reference to Greek Life
**Severity:** LOW

Four character files note KSA membership but none reference I_UCLA_GreekLife.md. This is a structural gap rather than a content gap — the data exists but the institutional context link is missing.
